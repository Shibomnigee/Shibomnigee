- 👋 Hi, I’m @Shibomnigee
- 👀 I’m interested in the famous purple stuffed worm in flap-jaw space with the tuning fork does a raw blink on Hara-Kiri Rock.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning something happened to me last Thursday when I was driving home. I had a couple of miles to go - I looked up and saw a glowing orange object in the sky, to the east! It was moving very irregularly... suddenly there was intense light all around me - and when I came to, I was home. What do you think happened to me?
- 💞️ Actually, I am in really bad shape financially. I pay money to my ex-wife as part of our divorce settlement, among other bills... I just had no choice but to make you pay for lunch the other day. I'm really sorry.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
- 😄 Pronouns: I'm not home right now. Please leave a message after the beep. BEEP!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was a North American Fall Webworm in my past life. Those were the good old days... What were you in your former life?
